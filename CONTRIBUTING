Some quick notes:

- Please file an issue before submitting a PR. This lets us discuss what you're planning and lets me help potentially guide design where needed.

- All PRs must have accompanying tests that exercise the functionality delta being presented. PRs won't be merged without the entire branch passing all tests.

- Please adhere to the style/conventions of the codebase. I've done my best to keep the code consistent, and I expect the same from others.

- ProtoPoet was developed using Bazel in a Linux environment. YMMV if you're attempting to develop outside of those expectations. Please file bugs/PRs to address issues if you can!
